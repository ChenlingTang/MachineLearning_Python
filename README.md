# MachineLearning_Python
This is a project to recording the every step of Machine learning in python, for self training purpose, from a beginner to master. 
All the material would keep update until the last day of the world ^_^

## This Study Plan would be into 4 sections:
1. The basic skill and structure of Python
2. The four fundamental libraries (Numpy; Pandas; Matplotlib; Seaborn) 
3. The classic ML models formula devrival and application
4. The real-life Cases practice
